# README

I'm learning NEOVIM and by keeping it in git means I can sync the config between
my Linux Hosts

Current goals

- Get Neorg setup for my notes
- Get blink setup with auto complete in code
- Probably integrate chatgpt or something to avoid the copy and paste

## LazyVIM

### Leaders (SPACE)

SPACE - File picker
u - UI Enable/Disable stuff
][b - Switch Buffer (Tabs)

### Keymaps

Open the keymap.lua file, and add entries there

### TODO

- [x] Play with GIT integration
- [ ] Figure out :terminal
- [ ] Figure out how to disable auto complete for markdown

### Co-Pilot

Seems to be working, but not sure how to use it yet. But in the base it's typing
and then just pressing enter. If this thing does a co-pilot call whenever I'm
typing, then I suddenly understand why we have such high energy bills.
