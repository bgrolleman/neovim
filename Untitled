I'm learning NEOVIM and by keeping it in git means I can sync the config between my Linux Hosts

Current goals

- Get Neorg setup for my notes
- Get cmp setup with auto complete in code
- Probably integrate chatgpt or something to avoid the copy and paste


## LazyVIM

### Leaders (SPACE)
SPACE - File picker
u - UI Enable/Disable stuff 
][b - Switch Buffer (Tabs)

### Keymaps
Open the keymap.lua file, and add entries there
